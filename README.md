# DearPyGui MVC Calculator

With this mini project I would like to demonstrate one of the ways you can structure your code using DearPyGui.
Here I tried to visualize the MVC concept, i.e. Model, View, Controller.
I hope maybe for some people this project will help to understand MVC concept
and also shows a good way to structure your code using Python and DearPyGui.


### Model
Model is the place where all classes that represent the data of our program should located.

### View
View is the part responsible for creating the graphical interface of our program.

### Controller
Controller is a kind of layer between the GUI and data models. It connects them and thanks to it the actions happening on the screen affect the data model.
